## LCD Display
  It will display the water level in the tank and the status.
## Control pannel
  Helps us in selecting time and mode of cooking.
## Temperatura Sensor
  This Safety lock sensor gives data to Micro Controller whether door is open or close while cooking.
## Auto Cutoff (safety sensor)
  Stops the oven if door is open while cooking.
## Motor Driver
  Used to drive the motor to cook food uniformly.
## Rotary Motor (Actuator)
  Rotates the food while cooking with the help of base plate so that food is cooked uniformly.
## Clock
  This helps the microcontroller to control the timing and rotating of the device.
## Heating element
  It will generate heat to cook the food 
## MicroController
  Performs all the important operations and helps our oven to work correctly without any damages by controlling all the inputs and outputs accordingly.
## Power
  It suppily power to the microcontroller as well as the heating element.
